# Databases and DBMS

## Terminology 
* **DB**: an organized collection of structured information (data), typically controlled by a DBMS.
* **DBMS**: Interface between DB and its end-users/programs
* **Schema**: Defines the shape of the data structure and what kinds of data can go where. 

## Types
![database-types](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karanpratapsingh/portfolio/master/public/static/courses/system-design/chapter-II/databases-and-dbms/database-types.png)

- **[SQL](https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/sql-databases)**
- **[NoSQL](https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/nosql-databases)**: Document, Key-value, Graph, Timeseries, Wide column, Multi-model

SQL and NoSQL databases are broad topics and will be discussed separately in [SQL databases](https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/sql-databases) and [NoSQL databases](https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/nosql-databases). Learn how they compare to each other in [SQL vs NoSQL databases](https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/sql-vs-nosql-databases).

## Challenges

- **Handling Data Volume**: Managing the surge of data from various sources like sensors and connected devices.
- **Data Security**: With increasing data breaches, ensuring secure yet accessible data is paramount.
- **Meeting Real-time Demand**: Providing immediate data access for prompt decision-making and opportunity leverage.
- **Database Management**: The growing complexity and volume of data necessitate more skilled personnel for database management.
- **Scalability**: Businesses need scalable data management solutions to accommodate growth, despite uncertain future capacity needs.
- **Compliance with Data Residency and Latency**: Certain use cases require on-premises solutions to meet data residency, sovereignty, and latency needs.

# SQL databases
- **Structure**: Organizes data into tables with columns (attributes) and rows (entities).
- **Data Organization**: Each table represents different objects, with columns defining data types and rows encapsulating attributes.
- **Primary Key**: Unique identifier for each row, ensuring row distinctness.
- **Foreign Keys**: Establish relationships between tables, allowing relational database functionality.
- **Data Access**: Supports various access methods without altering table structure.
- **Consistency Model**: Adheres to the [ACID consistency model](https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/acid-and-base-consistency-models#acid).

| Pros                 | Cons                                     |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Simple and accurate  | Expensive to maintain                    |
| Accessibility        | Difficult schema evolution               |
| Data consistency     | Performance hits (join, denormalization) |
| Flexibility          | Difficult to scale due to poor horizontal scalability |


# NoSQL databases

NoSQL is a broad category that includes any database that doesn't use SQL as its primary data access language. These types of databases are also sometimes referred to as non-relational databases. Unlike in relational databases, data in a NoSQL database doesn't have to conform to a pre-defined schema. NoSQL databases follow [BASE consistency model](https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/acid-and-base-consistency-models#base).

| Pros                        | Cons             |
|-----------------------------|------------------|
| Intuitive and flexible      | Schemaless       |
| Easy horizontal scaling     | Non-relational   |
| Schemaless                  |                  |

Below are different types of NoSQL databases:

### Document

A document database (also known as a document-oriented database or a document store) is a database that stores information in documents. They are general-purpose databases that serve a variety of use cases for both transactional and analytical applications.





### Key-value

One of the simplest types of NoSQL databases, key-value databases save data as a group of key-value pairs made up of two data items each. They're also sometimes referred to as a key-value store.

**Advantages**

- Simple and performant
- Highly scalable for high volumes of traffic
- Session management
- Optimized lookups

**Disadvantages**

- Basic CRUD
- Values can't be filtered
- Lacks indexing and scanning capabilities
- Not optimized for complex queries

**Examples**

- [Redis](https://redis.io)
- [Memcached](https://memcached.org)
- [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb)
- [Aerospike](https://aerospike.com)

### Graph

A graph database is a NoSQL database that uses graph structures for semantic queries with nodes, edges, and properties to represent and store data instead of tables or documents.

The graph relates the data items in the store to a collection of nodes and edges, the edges representing the relationships between the nodes. The relationships allow data in the store to be linked together directly and, in many cases, retrieved with one operation.

**Advantages**

- Query speed
- Agile and flexible
- Explicit data representation

**Disadvantages**

- Complex
- No standardized query language

**Use cases**

- Fraud detection
- Recommendation engines
- Social networks
- Network mapping

**Examples**

- [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com)
- [ArangoDB](https://www.arangodb.com)
- [Amazon Neptune](https://aws.amazon.com/neptune)
- [JanusGraph](https://janusgraph.org)

### Time series

A time-series database is a database optimized for time-stamped, or time series, data.

**Advantages**

- Fast insertion and retrieval
- Efficient data storage

**Use cases**

- IoT data
- Metrics analysis
- Application monitoring
- Understand financial trends

**Examples**

- [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com)
- [Apache Druid](https://druid.apache.org)

### Wide column

Wide column databases, also known as wide column stores, are schema-agnostic. Data is stored in column families, rather than in rows and columns.

**Advantages**

- Highly scalable, can handle petabytes of data
- Ideal for real-time big data applications

**Disadvantages**

- Expensive
- Increased write time

**Use cases**

- Business analytics
- Attribute-based data storage

**Examples**

- [BigTable](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable)
- [Apache Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org)
- [ScyllaDB](https://www.scylladb.com)

### Multi-model

Multi-model databases combine different database models (i.e. relational, graph, key-value, document, etc.) into a single, integrated backend. This means they can accommodate various data types, indexes, queries, and store data in more than one model.

**Advantages**

- Flexibility
- Suitable for complex projects
- Data consistent

**Disadvantages**

- Complex
- Less mature

**Examples**

- [ArangoDB](https://www.arangodb.com)
- [Azure Cosmos DB](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/cosmos-db)
- [Couchbase](https://www.couchbase.com)

# SQL vs NoSQL databases

In the world of databases, there are two main types of solutions, SQL (relational) and NoSQL (non-relational) databases. Both of them differ in the way they were built, the kind of information they store, and how they store it. Relational databases are structured and have predefined schemas while non-relational databases are unstructured, distributed, and have a dynamic schema.

## High-level differences

Here are some high-level differences between SQL and NoSQL:

### Storage

SQL stores data in tables, where each row represents an entity and each column represents a data point about that entity.

NoSQL databases have different data storage models such as key-value, graph, document, etc.

### Schema

In SQL, each record conforms to a fixed schema, meaning the columns must be decided and chosen before data entry and each row must have data for each column. The schema can be altered later, but it involves modifying the database using migrations.

Whereas in NoSQL, schemas are dynamic. Fields can be added on the fly, and each _record_ (or equivalent) doesn't have to contain data for each _field_.

### Querying

SQL databases use SQL (structured query language) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful.

In a NoSQL database, queries are focused on a collection of documents. Different databases have different syntax for querying.

### Scalability

In most common situations, SQL databases are vertically scalable, which can get very expensive. It is possible to scale a relational database across multiple servers, but this is a challenging and time-consuming process.

On the other hand, NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable, meaning we can add more servers easily to our NoSQL database infrastructure to handle large traffic. Any cheap commodity hardware or cloud instances can host NoSQL databases, thus making it a lot more cost-effective than vertical scaling. A lot of NoSQL technologies also distribute data across servers automatically.

### Reliability

The vast majority of relational databases are ACID compliant. So, when it comes to data reliability and a safe guarantee of performing transactions, SQL databases are still the better bet.

Most of the NoSQL solutions sacrifice ACID compliance for performance and scalability.

## Reasons

As always we should always pick the technology that fits the requirements better. So, let's look at some reasons for picking SQL or NoSQL based database:

**For SQL**

- Structured data with strict schema
- Relational data
- Need for complex joins
- Transactions
- Lookups by index are very fast

**For NoSQL**

- Dynamic or flexible schema
- Non-relational data
- No need for complex joins
- Very data-intensive workload
- Very high throughput for IOPS

# Database Replication

Replication is a process that involves sharing information to ensure consistency between redundant resources such as multiple databases, to improve reliability, fault-tolerance, or accessibility.

## Master-Slave Replication

The master serves reads and writes, replicating writes to one or more slaves, which serve only reads. Slaves can also replicate additional slaves in a tree-like fashion. If the master goes offline, the system can continue to operate in read-only mode until a slave is promoted to a master or a new master is provisioned.

![master-slave-replication](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karanpratapsingh/portfolio/master/public/static/courses/system-design/chapter-II/database-replication/master-slave-replication.png)

### Advantages

- Backups of the entire database of relatively no impact on the master.
- Applications can read from the slave(s) without impacting the master.
- Slaves can be taken offline and synced back to the master without any downtime.

### Disadvantages

- Replication adds more hardware and additional complexity.
- Downtime and possibly loss of data when a master fails.
- All writes also have to be made to the master in a master-slave architecture.
- The more read slaves, the more we have to replicate, which will increase replication lag.

## Master-Master Replication

Both masters serve reads/writes and coordinate with each other. If either master goes down, the system can continue to operate with both reads and writes.

![master-master-replication](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karanpratapsingh/portfolio/master/public/static/courses/system-design/chapter-II/database-replication/master-master-replication.png)

### Advantages

- Applications can read from both masters.
- Distributes write load across both master nodes.
- Simple, automatic, and quick failover.

### Disadvantages

- Not as simple as master-slave to configure and deploy.
- Either loosely consistent or have increased write latency due to synchronization.
- Conflict resolution comes into play as more write nodes are added and as latency increases.

## Synchronous vs Asynchronous replication

The primary difference between synchronous and asynchronous replication is how the data is written to the replica. In synchronous replication, data is written to primary storage and the replica simultaneously. As such, the primary copy and the replica should always remain synchronized.

In contrast, asynchronous replication copies the data to the replica after the data is already written to the primary storage. Although the replication process may occur in near-real-time, it is more common for replication to occur on a scheduled basis and it is more cost-effective.

# Indexes

Indexes are well known when it comes to databases, they are used to improve the speed of data retrieval operations on the data store. An index makes the trade-offs of increased storage overhead, and slower writes (since we not only have to write the data but also have to update the index) for the benefit of faster reads. Indexes are used to quickly locate data without having to examine every row in a database table. Indexes can be created using one or more columns of a database table, providing the basis for both rapid random lookups and efficient access to ordered records.

![indexes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karanpratapsingh/portfolio/master/public/static/courses/system-design/chapter-II/indexes/indexes.png)

An index is a data structure that can be perceived as a table of contents that points us to the location where actual data lives. So when we create an index on a column of a table, we store that column and a pointer to the whole row in the index. Indexes are also used to create different views of the same data. For large data sets, this is an excellent way to specify different filters or sorting schemes without resorting to creating multiple additional copies of the data.

One quality that database indexes can have is that they can be **dense** or **sparse**. Each of these index qualities comes with its own trade-offs. Let's look at how each index type would work:

## Dense Index

In a dense index, an index record is created for every row of the table. Records can be located directly as each record of the index holds the search key value and the pointer to the actual record.

![dense-index](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karanpratapsingh/portfolio/master/public/static/courses/system-design/chapter-II/indexes/dense-index.png)

Dense indexes require more maintenance than sparse indexes at write-time. Since every row must have an entry, the database must maintain the index on inserts, updates, and deletes. Having an entry for every row also means that dense indexes will require more memory. The benefit of a dense index is that values can be quickly found with just a binary search. Dense indexes also do not impose any ordering requirements on the data.

## Sparse Index

In a sparse index, index records are created only for some of the records.

![sparse-index](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karanpratapsingh/portfolio/master/public/static/courses/system-design/chapter-II/indexes/sparse-index.png)

Sparse indexes require less maintenance than dense indexes at write-time since they only contain a subset of the values. This lighter maintenance burden means that inserts, updates, and deletes will be faster. Having fewer entries also means that the index will use less memory. Finding data is slower since a scan across the page typically follows the binary search. Sparse indexes are also optional when working with ordered data.

# Normalization and Denormalization

## Terms

Before we go any further, let's look at some commonly used terms in normalization and denormalization.

### Keys

**Primary key**: Column or group of columns that can be used to uniquely identify every row of the table.

**Composite key**: A primary key made up of multiple columns.

**Super key**: Set of all keys that can uniquely identify all the rows present in a table.

**Candidate key**: Attributes that identify rows uniquely in a table.

**Foreign key**: It is a reference to a primary key of another table.

**Alternate key**: Keys that are not primary keys are known as alternate keys.

**Surrogate key**: A system-generated value that uniquely identifies each entry in a table when no other column was able to hold properties of a primary key.

### Dependencies

**Partial dependency**: Occurs when the primary key determines some other attributes.

**Functional dependency**: It is a relationship that exists between two attributes, typically between the primary key and non-key attribute within a table.

**Transitive functional dependency**: Occurs when some non-key attribute determines some other attribute.

### Anomalies

Database anomaly happens when there is a flaw in the database due to incorrect planning or storing everything in a flat database. This is generally addressed by the process of normalization.

There are three types of database anomalies:

**Insertion anomaly**: Occurs when we are not able to insert certain attributes in the database without the presence of other attributes.

**Update anomaly**: Occurs in case of data redundancy and partial update. In other words, a correct update of the database needs other actions such as addition, deletion, or both.

**Deletion anomaly**: Occurs where deletion of some data requires deletion of other data.

**Example**

Let's consider the following table which is not normalized:

| ID  | Name   | Role              | Team |
| --- | ------ | ----------------- | ---- |
| 1   | Peter  | Software Engineer | A    |
| 2   | Brian  | DevOps Engineer   | B    |
| 3   | Hailey | Product Manager   | C    |
| 4   | Hailey | Product Manager   | C    |
| 5   | Steve  | Frontend Engineer | D    |

Let's imagine, we hired a new person "John" but they might not be assigned a team immediately. This will cause an _insertion anomaly_ as the team attribute is not yet present.

Next, let's say Hailey from Team C got promoted, to reflect that change in the database, we will need to update 2 rows to maintain consistency which can cause an _update anomaly_.

Finally, we would like to remove Team B but to do that we will also need to remove additional information such as name and role, this is an example of a _deletion anomaly_.

## Normalization

Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database. This includes creating tables and establishing relationships between those tables according to rules designed both to protect the data and to make the database more flexible by eliminating redundancy and inconsistent dependency.

### Why do we need normalization?

The goal of normalization is to eliminate redundant data and ensure data is consistent. A fully normalized database allows its structure to be extended to accommodate new types of data without changing the existing structure too much. As a result, applications interacting with the database are minimally affected.

### Normal forms

Normal forms are a series of guidelines to ensure that the database is normalized. Let's discuss some essential normal forms:

**1NF**

For a table to be in the first normal form (1NF), it should follow the following rules:

- Repeating groups are not permitted.
- Identify each set of related data with a primary key.
- Set of related data should have a separate table.
- Mixing data types in the same column is not permitted.

**2NF**

For a table to be in the second normal form (2NF), it should follow the following rules:

- Satisfies the first normal form (1NF).
- Should not have any partial dependency.

**3NF**

For a table to be in the third normal form (3NF), it should follow the following rules:

- Satisfies the second normal form (2NF).
- Transitive functional dependencies are not permitted.

**BCNF**

Boyce-Codd normal form (or BCNF) is a slightly stronger version of the third normal form (3NF) used to address certain types of anomalies not dealt with by 3NF as originally defined. Sometimes it is also known as the 3.5 normal form (3.5NF).

For a table to be in the Boyce-Codd normal form (BCNF), it should follow the following rules:

- Satisfied the third normal form (3NF).
- For every functional dependency X → Y, X should be the super key.

_There are more normal forms such as 4NF, 5NF, and 6NF but we won't discuss them here. Check out this [amazing video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFQaEYEc8_8) that goes into detail._

In a relational database, a relation is often described as _"normalized"_ if it meets the third normal form. Most 3NF relations are free of insertion, update, and deletion anomalies.

As with many formal rules and specifications, real-world scenarios do not always allow for perfect compliance. If you decide to violate one of the first three rules of normalization, make sure that your application anticipates any problems that could occur, such as redundant data and inconsistent dependencies.

### Advantages

Here are some advantages of normalization:

- Reduces data redundancy.
- Better data design.
- Increases data consistency.
- Enforces referential integrity.

### Disadvantages

Let's look at some disadvantages of normalization:

- Data design is complex.
- Slower performance.
- Maintenance overhead.
- Require more joins.

## Denormalization

Denormalization is a database optimization technique in which we add redundant data to one or more tables. This can help us avoid costly joins in a relational database. It attempts to improve read performance at the expense of some write performance. Redundant copies of the data are written in multiple tables to avoid expensive joins.

Once data becomes distributed with techniques such as federation and sharding, managing joins across the network further increases complexity. Denormalization might circumvent the need for such complex joins.

_Note: Denormalization does not mean reversing normalization._

### Advantages
Let's look at some advantages of denormalization:
- Retrieving data is faster.
- Writing queries is easier.
- Reduction in number of tables.
- Convenient to manage.

### Disadvantages
Below are some disadvantages of denormalization:
- Expensive inserts and updates.
- Increases complexity of database design.
- Increases data redundancy.
- More chances of data inconsistency.
